# LocalSourceControl

LocalSourceControl is a lightweight desktop backup tool for local file history.  
It watches selected folders and automatically stores timestamped backup copies of changed files on your machine.

## What It Does
- Watches one or more folders for file changes.
- Stores backups in a local backup root, organized by original path.
- Lets you include/exclude files with CSV filters (including wildcard support).
- Shows backed-up files and backup history in a two-pane UI.
- Opens files/folders directly from the app and supports diffing backups vs originals.

## Development Note
