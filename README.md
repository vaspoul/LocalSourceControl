# LocalSourceControl

LocalSourceControl is a lightweight desktop backup tool for local file history.  
It watches selected folders and automatically stores timestamped backup copies of changed files on your machine.
It's mainly aimed at developers wishing to keep track of local changes in-between commits to actual source control.

## What It Does
- Watches one or more folders for file changes.
- Stores backups in a local backup root, organized by original path.
- Lets you include/exclude files with CSV filters (including wildcard support).
- Shows backed-up files and backup history in a two-pane UI.
- Opens files/folders directly from the app and supports diffing backups vs originals.

## Development Note
This project was developed primarily with AI assistance and thoroughly reviewed by a human.
